# Physics-Informed CNNs for the Poisson Equation 

This repository contains the implementation of my Bachelor's thesis.
It reproduces the PI-UNet framework of [Zhao et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105516) and extends it with **Gaussian blur** and **Gaussian noise** perturbations to systematically study model robustness.

- **Visualization of steady-state temperature fields** obtained with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and PI-UNet-based models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment

Make sure to install the correct version of PyTorch Lightning:  

```shell
torch==1.12.1+cu113
torchvision==0.13.1+cu113
pytorch-lightning==1.1.0
tensorboard
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib




## Data Preperation
Datasets used in this thesis are based on layouts from Zhao et al. If you generate or download datasets, update the configuration file (e.g., config_ul.yml) with your own paths:
data_root: /path/to/dataset/FDM
train_list: /path/to/train.txt
val_list: /path/to/val.txt
test_list: /path/to/test.txt


## Train and Test - Train the model without labeled data.
shell
cd example
python train_ul.py
- test the trained model. Please modify the position of trained model in the test.py, and
shell
python test.py


## üîß Perturbation Settings

The perturbation-aware extensions (Gaussian blur and additive Gaussian noise) are implemented in:

custom_transform.py

The intensity and usage of these perturbations are fully controlled through the YAML configuration files.
